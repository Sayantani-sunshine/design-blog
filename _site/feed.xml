M. Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pauginer.com/&quot;&gt;Pau Giner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wikimedia Foundation [WMF] has established the ambitious vision of making the sum of the world’s knowledge accessible to all the world’s people, by 2030. This vision necessitates a focus on scale: how to scale up content production, globally, and how to scale up access to this content in emerging contexts. Behind this need to scale is a critical design challenge: how to ensure a useful, usable and consistent reading experience while enabling rapid growth. To meet this challenge, WMF’s small but mighty Product Design team has developed a set of best practices and guidelines for product development across all of the Wikimedia Projects. This Design Style Guide, the first of its kind since the founding of Wikipedia in 2001, is both a means of maintaining consistency while scaling, and also a key contribution that product design is uniquely positioned to make –  in the Free Knowledge Movement, and across Wikimedia projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/consistency.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Wikipedia mobile in different writing systems&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The Wikipedia experience adapts to different contexts such as different mobile platforms and languages, while keeping the experience consistent. In the example, Android, web and iOS experiences are shown on top and part of the icon system at the bottom.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of  the Guide is to translate the core values of the Foundation into a language of design: this is for everyone, content has priority, usability guides aesthetics, and there is joy to be discovered in honest, open, and free communication. These values are not just idealizations, they are concretely expressed in the Design Team’s comprehensive suite of user interface visual elements (available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/resources.html&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; and use) and Wikimedia’s evolving  &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.wikimedia.org/oojs-ui/master/demos/?page=widgets&amp;amp;theme=wikimediaui&amp;amp;direction=ltr&amp;amp;platform=desktop&quot;&gt;Object Oriented User Interface&lt;/a&gt; (OOUI) JavaScript library that puts them to use. Taken together, the WMF Design Team has created a spectrum of engagement that includes those who want to see better-looking, more accessible and consistent design across Wikimedia projects (or the Web at large!), and folks who want to work with free design and interface-development resources. Even if you have never reflected on the effort that goes into creating the best user experiences—we take icons and UI components for granted until they break or confuse us—it is worth casually exploring these resources to get a sense of exactly how the Web can and should work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope and reach of the Design Team’s web UX conventions puts the Foundation in the company of other free, standards-based, and open source initiatives like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/&quot;&gt;United States Web Design System&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://getuikit.com/docs/introduction&quot;&gt;UIKit&lt;/a&gt; project, and in the same class as influential commercial giants like Apple, Facebook, and Google. However, unlike the design requirements of the governmental public sector, or multinational for-profit corporations, the Design Style is informed by the unique challenges associated with the heterogeneity that exists at all levels of large-scale, global, volunteer-driven projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked Pau Giner, one of the Design Team’s leads, how they negotiated a balance between the technical rigors of modern UX design, its pleasure principles (design is, after all, about a goodness), and inviting the participation of communities who do not take the first two actors for granted. This would include people who are new to working with Wikimedia projects, and designers who have never seen their expertise and insights play a part in pursuing the Foundation’s mission. One cannot design a comprehensive design standard by consensus, via self-organized volunteerism, or in direct response to every individual need. He provided an urban metaphor, contrasting the smaller winding streets of older cities like Barcelona (the utopian), with the regular and presumably more practical grids of Chicago or New York. I believe that part of Giner’s intent was to give a sense of what it would be like to introduce necessarily binding rules into a system that had developed in a largely organic fashion, but his metaphor goes further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/uploads/paper-ink.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ink and the Wikipedia wordmark on a paper&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Inspiration for the visual direction of the style guide came from traditional elements to capture knowledge such as paper and ink.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to Google’s Material Design, he describes the WMF Design Style Guide and its supporting resources as less “complete.” For now, it lacks Material’s formal guidelines for approaches to media, motion, and visual density for example, but according to Giner’s urban metaphor, a totalizing approach to all possible modalities of design would run counter to the bespoke intricacies developed during the lifetime of a collaborative project like Wikipedia. That said, some of what is considered “charming” about the plans of very old cities is a record of old solutions remaining  in service long after their original problems were solved. This creates some interesting tensions that the Design Team has tried to resolve through an open and flexible approach rather than a fixed set of top-down “universal” standards that demand adherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giner describes the team’s approach as co-evolutionary in the sense that it works closely with various Wikimedia communities that are already deeply invested, both conceptually and technically, in their tools and approaches to content. Working across a number of time zones and specialties, using hackathons and project management tools, the Design Team has collaborated with Wikimedians like Samantha Nguyen (&lt;a href=&quot;https://brickipedia.fandom.com/wiki/LEGO_Wiki&quot;&gt;Brickipedia&lt;/a&gt;), Nislihan Turan (volunteer on the Android Commons app), and numerous internal and cross-Foundation folks. Their contributions ranged from feedback to specifications design, to coordination and connecting normally separated communities such as designers and developers. Giner has also seen increased usage of the Style Guide among new Wikimedia editors and readers, coming—importantly—from non-English speaking communities all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Wikimedia project itself, the Style Guide serves as a kind of global ambassador, presenting itself to other communities as a demonstration of its own standards, and offering its own DNA, so to speak, as a solution. Communities with great passion and expertise in their field of knowledge, but varying levels of design and technical literacy, work transparently and collaboratively with Giner and his peers to pose and answer questions. This iterative responds to new questions that are raised, and avoids infinite regression, unilateral appeals to expertise, and the blandness of design-by-committee. The argument for a unified—but not necessarily comprehensive—design is not forced, but developed from the inside out, and guided by a respect for the specificity and diversity in communication that underlies the Foundation’s mission to make all of human knowledge available to everyone, without relying on any given human’s exclusive perspective. The Wikimedia Design Team’s particular alignment with the mission makes it real in that special way that steering wheels, doorknobs, light switches, and traffic signs simultaneously tell us what to do, and how things can be done, in a system where individuals are ultimately responsible for their own actions.&lt;/p&gt;

M. Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/claudiawylo&quot;&gt;Claudia Lo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/margeigh&quot;&gt;Margeigh Novotny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over 6 million articles on the English language version of Wikipedia, and 217 million more across the 731 other &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiProject&quot;&gt;wikiprojects&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.  These are mind-boggling numbers when considering the scale of human effort it takes to improve and police this much content, let alone monitor their online activities to detect and mitigate harassment. However, the Wikimedia Foundation and the Free Knowledge Movement remain vigilant, and dedicated to cultivating the most democratic practices and confronting some of the most antagonistic elements of Internet culture that Hermosillo&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-1&quot; id=&quot;ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; recognized and theorized about so long ago: the “black hole”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-1&quot; id=&quot;ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of toxicity, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperNormalisation&quot;&gt;hypernormalization&lt;/a&gt;, deepfakes and mass sock puppetry&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#note-2&quot; id=&quot;ref-2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that define online culture today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How then does a free and open volunteer-driven project like Wikipedia manage disinformation? The truth is that there is considerable effort to mitigate user harassment and article vandalism (editing in bad faith or with malicious intent­) on Wikipedia. I spoke to Claudia Lo, design researcher on the Wikimedia Foundation’s Anti-Harassment Tools team, and learned that the Foundation’s commitment to establishing ever-widening circles of inclusive participation makes one-size-fits-all solutions hard to come by (whether they’re policy-driven or technical). What remains consistent however, is the need for active human participation in moderation processes that involve complex technical and ethical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo’s background includes practical “in the trenches” experience as a volunteer moderator on Reddit and Discord, and academic media studies research that focused on the tools and technologies that Twitch moderators used during video game tournaments. Unlike these platforms where discourse is transient, and content was relatively unregulated,  Wikipedia’s editorial standards call for objective and citation-driven contributions. Wikipedia deals in truth and factuality over opinion and speculation, so when antagonism and disruption do emerge, the stakes are higher. Though Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_reliable_source&quot;&gt;does not consider itself a reliable source&lt;/a&gt;, it is trustworthy enough to attract those who would exploit privileges that the platform extends to all users in order to sow dissent, attack others, disrupt collaboration, push agendas, execute vendettas, and cultivate uncertainty. Such “bad actors” may see nothing of value in the Foundation’s mission to make all of the world’s knowledge available to all of the world’s people, but they know that a considerable portion of cyberspace’s netizens do, and that third-party search and knowledge base systems are making increasing use of its product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia content is always in-progress or in a state of being edited, so how does one distinguish active trolling, fierce but otherwise healthy partisanship, genuine disputes, and naivete or inexperience? Lo has seen it all: poor writing and incompetently structured pages, frivolous vanity articles, edit wars over celebrity birthdays, and people seeking revenge on their high school alma maters. There are also behind-the-scenes battles and truly ugly behavior on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki#Talk_page&quot;&gt;talk pages&lt;/a&gt; behind articles, as well as intense (and possibly state-sponsored) conflicts surrounding polarizing political figures and historical events. Fortunately, the emotional or epistemological aspects of vandalism and harassment activities can be separated from their technical ones, and such behavior leaves patterns in server logs and edit histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as a denial of service attack on a webserver can be automatically recognized based on the source and frequency of requests, a Wikipedia article that sees a high number of edits in a short period of time, or coming from the same IP address(es), can be flagged as potential vandalism. Because the ability to contribute and edit anonymously keeps barriers to participation low, reducing vandalism by banning accounts or blocking individual or ranges of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses contradicts the core aspects of the Wikimedia philosophy. As Hermosillo warned: “cyberspace is an increasingly efficient tool of surveillance with which people have a voluntary relationship,” so restricting contribution to registered users challenges the WMF commitment to privacy, as does the need to retain usage logs in order to perform systematic analysis of accounts associated with abusive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their part, IP blocking tactics are not only surmountable by dedicated bad actors, but they run afoul of broader protocol-related issues such as IP addresses that are assigned dynamically or in blocks. The risk of blanket restrictions preventing access for users that are not identified as bad actors is real. And yet tools that facilitate blocks, track spurious accounts, and initiate bans are the primary  means of thwarting abuse. In typical Wikimedia fashion, the chosen solution does not involve restricting access to these tools—thereby creating a kind of police force—but making them more accessible to the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with moderation technology requires the ability to parse and cross-reference lots of information, to recognize patterns, and pay attention to constantly-shifting details. Such forensic skills are not exclusive to any one group of people, but the complexity of the tools themselves restricts their use to those who are already in the technical and/or cultural position to use them. As a designer, Claudia Lo wants to make these tools easier to use—right now they can involve a headache-inducing combination of spreadsheets and dozens of browser tabs. Put another way, Lo believes that one should not have to be an alpha nerd if one wants to contribute to the community moderation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to hear Lo describe this as a “utilitarian” effort, but as I listened to her describe the straightforward strategies that Twitch moderators used to do their jobs I came to understand that this remains a deeply human challenge. AI may eventually be able to execute some of the Twitch moderators’ heuristics, such as using lists of inappropriate words or phrases in various languages in conjunction with real-time parsing of text streams’ content and points of origin. But Wikipedia’s problems are not reducible to flagging inappropriate language and booting trolls, especially in a political era that has considerable trouble grappling with issues of censorship, and what “free” speech and expression means when one’s identity online is effectively disposable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the impression from Lo that there were no magic bullets to be crafted, but this is far from a concession or a retreat. The Anti-Harassment Team’s approach is consistent with the Foundation’s tendency to work incrementally to gradually improve the system over time, and in cooperation with community volunteers. But in this particular case, applying human-centered design to the problem of moderation tools’ overwhelming complexity will give more people the opportunity to address vandalism and harassment in their respective communities rather than relying exclusively on a highly technical and top down moderation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;footer&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;note-1&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; In 1994 Carmen “humdog” Hermosillo wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/kolber/2131643&quot;&gt;pandora’s vox: on community in cyberspace&lt;/a&gt;, a prescient and pioneering critique of online life’s everyday practices. In this  essay she calls cyberspace a “black hole” that, in commodifying our attention spans, “absorbs energy and personality and then re-presents it as spectacle.” Today, such a description could be applied to any online platform whose technical infrastructure and/or community model is descended from the glory days of Web 2.0’s “user-generated content.”&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a designer at the Wikimedia Foundation means I am reasonably accustomed to working remotely – both geographically, and in the sense of being the sole designer in a cross-functional team. For the past 2 years I’ve worked in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Growth&quot;&gt;Growth team&lt;/a&gt;, whose goal is to increase the number of new contributors on wiki projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2019, for a number of reasons (logistics of scheduling 10 people spread all around the world, financial prudence, desire to reduce the carbon footprint of travel), we decided to trial holding our team offsite virtually. At the time it seemed like a novel experiment to try, but in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, I have since realized that this might be the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our team’s program manager, Jazmin Tanner published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ItsJazTanner/how-planning-a-virtual-offsite-prepared-me-for-covid-19-remote-work-c0e92bb4fefb&quot;&gt;richly detailed piece&lt;/a&gt; on her experience organizing the entire offsite virtually, I decided to write this post based on my specific role as the designer tasked with running a “mini-design sprint” virtually as part of the proceedings, with reflections on what things worked well (and not so well) for more virtual design sprints that will likely be in our futures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-the-scene&quot;&gt;Setting the scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goals-and-expectations&quot;&gt;Goals and expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do was to set clear objectives for the event. For the Growth team, our aims were two-fold. Firstly, it was to finalise work on our current project to introduce “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Growth/Personalized_first_day/Newcomer_tasks&quot;&gt;Suggested edits&lt;/a&gt;” (small editing tasks) to new users in the Wikipedia languages we work with to pilot our new features. As the designer on the team, it was my responsibility to lead ideation for the offsite’s second aim: to address our longer term goal of creating a &lt;strong&gt;cohesive newcomer experience&lt;/strong&gt; so that new Wikipedia users feel welcomed and encouraged to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;audience-and-constraints&quot;&gt;Audience and constraints&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet these challenges we had to integrate the diverse perspectives of our team, which consisted of myself, a product manager, a program manager, three engineers, an engineering manager, a QA analyst, a data analyst, and a community relations specialist. Some members of our team had participated in a couple of design sprints before, others had limited experience with the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I saw it there were 3 main challenges in adapting the traditional / formal design sprint format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;: How might we complete a nimble ~3 hour design sprint when it typically takes a few days? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance&lt;/strong&gt;: How might we successfully discuss and sketch together to generate ideas when everyone is remote? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;: How might we encourage participation amongst non-designers who may be unfamiliar, daunted and/or plain dislike the format and tools used? (sketching is not enjoyable for everyone!) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional constraint on time was that the design “mini-sprint” was to be broken up into two sessions on days #2 and #4 of a four-day long virtual offsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;over-planning-ahead&quot;&gt;(Over) Planning ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the oft-quoted saying that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal&quot;&gt;I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time&lt;/a&gt;” applies to sprint planning too. Doing more pre-planning including creating pre-reading for participants was important in ensuring the shorter sprint format had a chance of being executed well, and in time.  Prior to the whole offsite, the team responded to a short survey with their hopes and fears, which helped immensely with deciding the mix of passive/active participation and level of group vs individual work to include.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also essential to planning was determining the focus of the design sprint activity, and then tailoring (and paring down) only the most relevant activities to achieve that goal. Taking cues from a few other blog posts about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@designsprintstudio/the-one-hour-brain-sprint-409fc5417e10&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.prototypr.io/the-2-hour-design-sprint-9e2bbc14ee1&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ux.shopify.com/the-4-hour-design-sprint-b05b516cede7&quot;&gt;four hour&lt;/a&gt; design sprints, I decided in session #1 to use some parts of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/overview&quot;&gt;Google Ventures design sprint&lt;/a&gt; method, with the question of “How might we create an integrated newcomer homepage” as the overarching prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sprinting-what-happened-on-the-growth-sprint&quot;&gt;Sprinting: What happened on the Growth sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section discusses what we did during the sprint, before I then delve into more details on the tools and resources used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;session-one-diverging-and-ideating&quot;&gt;Session One: Diverging and ideating&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product manager and I gave lightning talks on different key themes around the newcomer experience, while each person wrote down their ideas in the “How Might We…” (HMW) format: a way of describing ideas and challenges positively in the form of an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Growth team already had a pretty comprehensive understanding of the project, so as anticipated there was a diverse range of HMWs generated. I then took the team through an affinity mapping exercise – essentially a fancy term for organizing similar ideas into groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We voted for the top five ideas from the affinity groups and proceeded to the sketch phase (the third Google DS Methodology phase) where participants created “pitch posters” (see example in the facilitation deck linked at the end resources). During these break-out sessions people worked in pairs to design interaction flows and user experiences in as high or low fidelity as they were comfortable working with, and returned to the group to present to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;session-two-converging-on-key-insights&quot;&gt;Session Two: Converging on key insights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the “wrap-up” session where we reviewed the top ideas generated in the first session, and ended with a fun exercise to help each team member reflect on the different perspectives brought to the newcomer homepage’s upcoming feature work. From here, the intention was that each team member could better articulate and advocate for priorities from their preferred position, and help drive the product direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed a collaborative decision-making activity that wasn’t purely democractic, but was still open, transparent, and hopefully fun. I invented the “Marry, Move, Kill” activity in which each person would describe their dream newcomer homepage based on the existing homepage as well as sections that had been voted on the previous day. From these candidates, each team member must “marry” sections to their home page, “move” others, and “kill” at least one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;documenting-the-outcomes-post-sprint&quot;&gt;Documenting the outcomes post-sprint&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One benefit of the virtual sprint is that format lends itself for easier documenting.  In the case of many conference call apps, you can literally record the sessions. Whilst we didn’t do so for the design sessions this time around, there were a few key outcomes documented in the various notes and artefacts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identified a future feature&lt;/strong&gt;: Building out a Mentor dashboard to help experienced editors better guide new contributors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insights about tailoring specific features to Mobile or Desktop&lt;/strong&gt;: Experimenting with different experiences and on mobile and desktop - realising that a cohesive experience does not necessarily require parity of features available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confirmation about product direction&lt;/strong&gt;: Driving editing as the focus of the newcomer homepage feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta-outcome&lt;/strong&gt;: Getting a better sense of each team member’s priorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;choosing-suitable-tools-for&quot;&gt;Choosing suitable tools for…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;remote-friendly-participation&quot;&gt;Remote-friendly participation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design sprints can be challenging even when people are face-to-face. Managing the process remotely had to address such variables as connection speeds, platform diversity, familiarity with remote collaboration tools, and general comfort with doing this kind of work via video conference. So much can be lost without the cues and subtleties of being co-located, so it was important to choose remote-collaboration tools that were both reliable, and relatively familiar for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Meet was used for all video conferencing and communication, Google Slides to create and present the facilitation deck (and supporting materials), and Figma for our collaborative design sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;video-conferencing&quot;&gt;Video conferencing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used Google Meet for both the main event, as well as breaking out  into smaller groups in ‘side Meets’ for the sketch phase, but only on the first day, as it seemed like too much time spent out of group discussion dissipated focus. We did no breakout sessions on day two to allow the team to concentrate on the Marry, Move, Kill exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;facilitating&quot;&gt;Facilitating&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a facilitation deck that communicated each session’s goals and served as the roadmap for the sprint. I chose Google Slides because as with Meet, everyone was already familiar with the tool. For presenting over a video call, it turned out to be very useful to not only have this deck, but having it under the management and control of a single presenter meant easy incorporation of useful facilitator tools like countdown timers (via embedding YouTube videos like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn31KFenBIo&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) and reaction GIFs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collaborating&quot;&gt;Collaborating&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sketch phase I used Figma, a web-based collaborative design tool, to create templates and design elements that were intended to help non-designers participate more easily (through being able to copy and paste existing visual elements). In retrospect, even Figma proved to be too finicky for some on the team (and this was even with a “warm-up exercise” to get team members familiar with using it). I recommend using collaboration tools that everyone in a group is familiar with or can get up to speed on quickly. Google slides could have been used instead, and so could paper and pencil sketches that could have been photographed and shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr-checklist-for-the-next-virtual-sprint&quot;&gt;TL;DR: Checklist for the next virtual sprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there is definitely value in having in-person meetings that a remote event can never match completely, there are some benefits of the format that may help offset the social/bonding cost. Being alone in their own environments may be beneficial in helping participants to focus, albeit in shorter online doses. The following are some thoughts for how I would try to plan the next sprint so that folks go from being a captive audience to a captivated participant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plan&quot;&gt;Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set clear objectives for what should be accomplished at the end of the sprint.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tailor to your audience. Determine how much onboarding for an idea or activity may be necessary for the particular group’s knowledge/skill set/interests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preview content if possible. Sharing the agenda, introducing tools, rubrics, etc. &lt;em&gt;beforehand&lt;/em&gt; can reduce the amount of introduction required.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand the scope. Don’t try to shoot the moon in 3 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide enough time, then add a few more minutes for transition time for good measure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assign a moderator and note-taker.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incorporate some ‘fun’ activities too. Interspersing sessions with some short ice-breaker type activities will help folks get comfortable chatting and sharing ideas over video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;provide&quot;&gt;Provide&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An overview of goals, activities, and metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Warm-up exercises to get familiar and comfortable with relatively new collaboration tools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More interactive and entertaining-framing on activities can help inject some more social enjoyment that is missed from not having an in-person event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Opportunities for smaller sessions and regrouping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Templates for collaboration and assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collaborate&quot;&gt;Collaborate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use templates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick the right tool for the collaborative job.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on enabling everyone to contribute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Break out and regroup as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reflect&quot;&gt;Reflect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look back on what has been done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measure against stated goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share the results.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide opportunity for group feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-feedback-always-welcome&quot;&gt;More feedback always welcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the opinions in this writing are my own, the Wikimedia Design team strives to design in the open with a transparent and participatory process. With that in mind, we welcome any thoughts and experiences you may have on running a virtual design sprint, especially in a group where not everyone is a designer.&lt;/p&gt;

M. Goldberg&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Volker_E&quot;&gt;Volker Eckl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activist and political theorist Dr. Angela Y. Davis once stated that the most ethical way to assess the health of a society or institution is in terms of how it treats those who have been marginalized. Put another way, Dr. Davis is arguing that outliers are the true measure of a system’s values, not those who are assumed to be “typical,” “average,” “healthy,” or “normal.” More often than not, such adjectives describe the degree to which a person conforms to a system’s requirements, not a system’s ability to accommodate the diversity of their needs. In line with its democratic mission to make all of the world’s information available for free, across differences in culture, tradition, and language, the Wikimedia Foundation believes that everyone should have access to computing’s ever-increasing powers of content creation, distribution, and consumption. This ethic and its problem-solving strategies are part of inclusive design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever removed or put on your glasses, or held your device at arm’s length to better perceive a screen, then you have encountered issues that inclusive design tackles. The same can be said if you have done a text search on a video stream’s closed-captions, prefer your applications in “dark mode,” or struggled with a screen in bright sunlight. If you are a person using a screen reader or your operating system’s text-to-speech functions to access these words, or if you’ve ever dug deep into your system settings to adjust contrast and the scale of interface elements like pointers or text then you are also already literate in and benefitting from some aspects of inclusive design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikimedian &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Volker_E&quot;&gt;Volker Eckl&lt;/a&gt; is leading the team of Foundation designers that are pursuing the Foundation’s mission by implementing inclusive design at the level of the user-interface: that’s the geeky system of buttons, checkboxes, form patterns, typeface decisions, and careful considerations of spacing, color, and visual and behavioral consistency. We tend to notice a user-interface when it’s confusing or stops working, not when it is making content easier to read, recognize, and navigate. Projects that follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://design.wikimedia.org/style-guide/&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Design Style Guide&lt;/a&gt; implement the best practices in modern web design, leading to clean and reliable content experiences that are effective on your mobile device, laptop monitor, or gigantic flatscreen. These best practices also address web-specific accessibility issues, thereby making sure that the widest possible range of people can enjoy and participate in the creation of free knowledge content in the Wikimedia movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimism, it turns out, is highly technical work. Creating the Design Style Guide was one thing, but providing a world of volunteer producers, organizers, and users with the technology to implement it was another. To do so Volker and company pursue a couple of broad strategies: 1) making the work freely available, and open to modification by the global community the Foundation serves; and 2) doing a considerable amount of non-trivial, and largely invisible, work “under the hood” that makes the first strategy possible. These two pursuits involve managing a daunting array of technical, cultural, and aesthetic variables that include the character set for your language’s alphabet and the direction it reads, supporting text alternatives for multimedia content, balancing color contrast ratios to ensure readability, and ensuring content presentation in assistive technologies such as screen readers, speech-to-text systems, and braille translators. After several years of hard work, Volker and his peers have created clear aesthetic and technical guidelines for implementing design principles and fundamentals, provided tools to assist in producing accessible content, created a modern user interface library that anyone can integrate into their web-based projects, and built Wikimedia projects that meet these standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything we do is both for and with our bodies, though the convenience of technology can sometimes make us pretend like we don’t have them. “As our bodies change, we encounter more mismatched designs,” writes Kat Holmes in &lt;em&gt;Mismatch: How Inclusion Shapes Design&lt;/em&gt;, “simply because the designs that once worked well for us don’t change with us” (29). Access to some things we interact with are already segregated by factors such as age, so we don’t necessarily complain when we become physically incapable of doing something like skateboarding. Driving a vehicle has fuzzier edges, as anyone who has negotiated with a senior friend or relative well knows. Holmes also tells us that losing one’s privileges hurts, and it causes “anxiety, insecurity, anger, hostility, feelings of inadequacy, [and] a sense of being out of control” (33). The promise of inclusive design, for all of its challenges and complexities, is that it can contribute to someone experiencing the polar opposite of each one of these feelings. Volker and his peers aren’t just concerned with people who can’t or can no longer interact with certain aspects of the web. They are also addressing the mistaken thinking that people in that position are the only ones who benefit from rich and robust accessible design strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wikimedia Foundation leaders like Volker and his design team, and the community that make its projects viable and possible understand that notions of “ability/disability” and “capability/impairment” are flexible. They aren’t bound to fixed identities or politicized categories, and they aren’t imaginary or abstract either. Pursuing inclusive and accessible web design and development practices can establish infrastructure that is taken for granted in the future, like today’s searchable transcripts, automatic doors, and ramped curbs. Similarly, alternate descriptions and metadata that is goes unnoticed by most web users could be interpreted and translated into a language “spoken” through the vibrations of your phone, or used to create smart summaries of large data sets. Imagine getting a sense of an incoming message’s content without taking out your device, or being alerted to cool images in your social media feed without having to scroll through all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wikimedia Foundation aims to support a diverse audience, and it is committed to not raising barriers for one group of people as it seeks to improve the experience another has with its products and projects. Because Wikimedia projects are, at the level of their foundations, open and collaborative, a commitment to inclusive design that addresses more than the formal category of “disability” or “handicap” is a natural fit. Making all of the world’s knowledge freely available is a monumental task that some consider to be impossible. It is undoubtedly a slow process that cannot be managed from the top down in a fundamentally volunteer-driven movement, but it is absolutely worth it, because with the philosophical, ethical, and technical basis that Volker and his peers have provided, we are one step closer.&lt;/p&gt;

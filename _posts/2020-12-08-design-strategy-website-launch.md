<p class="post__excerpt">Making design research more accessible to our wiki project contributors and to the global design community</p>

The **Design Strategy Team** is pleased to announce the launch of [a new site](https://design.wikimedia.org/strategy/) which makes years of design research more accessible to our wiki project contributors and to the global design community. While most of this work is specific to the user experience of content creators and readers of Wikipedia on our various platforms, some of these studies are more generally applicable - for example, work related to [online social behavior](https://design.wikimedia.org/strategy/online-social-behavior.html) and use and training of [machine learning](https://design.wikimedia.org/strategy/machine-augmentation.html) applications may be of more general interest. If you find this to be the case [weâ€™d love to hear from you](mailto:desresadmin@wikimedia.org)!


[Design Strategy](https://design.wikimedia.org/strategy/team.html) supports product development at the Foundation by providing the qualitative and quantitative research that enables Product teams to make informed and inspired decisions. From explanations of what people do and want, to evaluations of what they experience, to experiments with new and emerging technologies, the research team answers the most urgent and impactful questions that stand in the way of achieving our vision of **a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge**.
